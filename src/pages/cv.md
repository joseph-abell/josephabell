# CV - Joseph Abell

I'm Joseph Abell, a full stack Typescript developer with 11 years experience. I'm currently working at Isotoma,
based in York, UK. I also develop websites for my wife's company, Abell Design, when time allows.

## Contact

Joseph Abell - jobs@josephabell.co.uk

## Tech

My ideal tech stack is a combination of:

- React (although I enjoy working with Svelte and Vue)
- Redux Web Kit (RTK Query)
- Typescript
- GraphQL
- AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit)
- Lambda (Typescript)
- AppSync, but Api Gateway is also fine
- S3
- DynamoDB
- Step Functions

## Places I've worked

### Isotoma - Full Stack Typescript Developer

Feb 2020 - current

I'm a full stack developer working on complex web applications.
As the teams at Isotoma are small, I'm trusted to deliver all aspects of
web apps. The usual tech stack includes React, typescript, AWS lambda, and dynamodb.

### Netsells - Senior Javascript Developer

September 2019 - Feb 2020

My role at Netsells was to write the frontend for Vue apps.

### Piksel - Senior Javascript Developer

March 2015 - September 2019

My job at Piksel changed over time, I was there a while, but at the end I
helped a large, multi-national team of 20+ developers to create a custom CMS for media companies.
I helped take an old Angular 1.5 app and rewrote it into a react app. I thoroughly
enjoyed working with a team of developers from Spain and Vietnam.

Also at Piksel I helped write a white label Video on Demand application
for web, android, ios and televisions.

### Purenet, and their sister company Agency51 - UI Developer

December 2012 - March 2015

My role was to deliver for websites, with a focus on accessibility.
